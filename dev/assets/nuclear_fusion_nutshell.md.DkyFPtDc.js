The most commonly considered case is Hydrogen fusion, where two Hydrogen atoms (one with one neutron, the other with two) fuse to output one Helium atom and a neutron at high velocity: <img class="marginauto" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Deuterium-tritium_fusion.svg/400px-Deuterium-tritium_fusion.svg.png" style="background-color:white;"></p><p>This reaction, if efficiently achievable, is the holy grail of clean energy. Helium is not a greenhouse gas, not radioactive, and escapes from Earth&#39;s atmosphere over time. Output yield is <em>ten million times</em> larger than combustion.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Deuterium is abundant, and (if fusion were efficiently achievable) can be fused to create tritium, which is otherwise rare.</p><p>The caveat, of course, is that this is really difficult to achieve. In order to bring atomic nuclei (which are positively charged and repel one another) close enough together to fuse, the current leading designs aim to compress and heat fusible atoms to immense pressures and temperatures (~100 million degrees Kelvin) to trigger fusion.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> It is reasonable to consdier this class of fusion reactor – this is, after all, how fusion occurs in stars.
