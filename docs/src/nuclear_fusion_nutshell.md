# Nuclear Fusion in a Nutshell

Fusion occurs when two atoms come in close enough proximity to combine. The most commonly considered case is Hydrogen fusion, where two Hydrogen atoms (one with one neutron, the other with two) fuse to output one Helium atom and a neutron at high velocity:

```

This reaction, if efficiently achievable, is the holy grail of clean energy. Helium is not a greenhouse gas, not radioactive, and escapes from Earth's atmosphere over time. Output yield is *ten million times* larger than combustion.[^1] Deuterium is abundant, and (if fusion were efficiently achievable) can be fused to create tritium, which is otherwise rare.

The caveat, of course, is that this is really difficult to achieve. In order to bring atomic nuclei (which are positively charged and repel one another) close enough together to fuse, the current leading designs aim to compress and heat fusible atoms to immense pressures and temperatures (~100 million degrees Kelvin) to trigger fusion.[^2] It is reasonable to consdier this class of fusion reactor -- this is, after all, how fusion occurs in stars. However, in spite of exciting recent breakthroughs, the challenges associated with creating an "artifical sun on earth" abound:

- The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), a multi-country initiative to build a test reactor in France by 2035, has [an expected cost of \$22B that could swell up to \$65B](https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/Online/4990/ITER-disputes-DOE-s-cost-estimate-of-fusion), according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
- In the U.S., the National Ignition Facility (NIF) [recently achieved fusion ignition](https://www.llnl.gov/article/49306/lawrence-livermore-national-laboratory-achieves-fusion-ignition) and generated more energy than it required to operate, but [at a total cost of \$3.5B](https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/faqs#nif_cost) its path to a sustainable nuclear reactor with a net-positive harvested energy remains unclear. 

Hundreds of millions of degrees, tens of billions of dollars *for an experiment*. The numbers are eye-watering. Thermonuclear fusion is a brute-force approach rife with challenges, but it's not the only option.
