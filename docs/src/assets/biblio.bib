abstract = {The principles for a continuously operating, nonplasma, nonthermal, fusion power source are presented. The fuel is a 2 MeV deutron beam which is injected, “debeamed” and “self-collided” through precession; the d-d reaction breeds a 3Hed self-colliding mixture (“migma”) which is the main source of fusion power. Because of continuing replenishment, the migma does not become Maxwellian. Direct conversion of fusion energy into electricity is accomplished by deceleration of the positively charged ions (fusion products). An elemental power source (“migmacell”) that can be built within the bounds of available technology would have a radius of 5 cm and deliver between 10 mW and 10 W of net electric power, depending on the assumptions on the space-charged limit. Ideas to increase the net power output, including local macro-neutralization, are indicated. We outline various ways to combine a large number of the migmacells into a 3-dimensional matrix to make a reactor capable of generating 10 kW of electric power.}

abstract = {Electronic bands in crystals are described by an ensemble of Bloch wave functions indexed by momenta defined in the first Brillouin Zone, and their associated energies. In an insulator, an energy gap around the chemical potential separates valence bands from conduction bands. The ensemble of valence bands is then a well defined object, which can possess nontrivial or twisted topological properties. In the case of a twisted topology, the insulator is called a topological insulator. We introduce this notion of topological order in insulators as an obstruction to define the Bloch wave functions over the whole Brillouin Zone using a single phase convention. Several simple historical models displaying a topological order in dimension two are considered. Various expressions of the corresponding topological index are finally discussed.
Résumé
Les bandes électroniques dans un cristal sont définies par un ensemble de fonctions dʼonde de Bloch dépendant du moment défini dans la première zone de Brillouin, ainsi que des énergies associées. Dans un isolant, les bandes de valence sont séparées des bandes de conduction par un gap en énergie. Lʼensemble des bandes de valence est alors un objet bien défini, qui peut en particulier posséder une topologie non triviale. Lorsque cela se produit, lʼisolant correspondant est appelé isolant topologique. Nous introduisons cette notion dʼordre topologique dʼune bande comme une obstruction à la définition des fonctions dʼondes de Bloch à lʼaide dʼune convention de phase unique. Plusieurs modèles simples dʼisolants topologiques en dimension deux sont considérés. Différentes expressions des indices topologiques correspondants sont finalement discutées.}

When the thickness of the quantum well is varied, the electronic state changes from a normal to an “inverted” type at a critical thickness dc. We show that this transition is a topological quantum phase transition between a conventional insulating phase and a phase exhibiting the QSH effect with a single pair of helical edge states. We also discuss methods for experimental detection of the QSH effect.}}

abstract = {Recent theory predicted that the quantum spin Hall effect, a fundamentally new quantum state of matter that exists at zero external magnetic field, may be realized in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. We fabricated such sample structures with low density and high mobility in which we could tune, through an external gate voltage, the carrier conduction from n-type to p-type, passing through an insulating regime. For thin quantum wells with well width d \&lt; 6.3 nanometers, the insulating regime showed the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells (d \&gt; 6.3 nanometers), the nominally insulating regime showed a plateau of residual conductance close to 2e2/h, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant. The residual conductance was independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance was destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, d = 6.3 nanometers, was also independently determined from the magnetic field–induced insulator-to-metal transition. These observations provide experimental evidence of the quantum spin Hall effect.}}

One of the most promising applications of quantum simulation is the study of strongly correlated Fermi gases, for which exact theoretical results are not always possible with state-of-the-art approaches. Here, we review recent progress of the quantum simulation of the emblematic Fermi–Hubbard model with ultracold atoms. After introducing the Fermi–Hubbard model in the context of condensed matter, its implementation in ultracold atom systems, and its phase diagram, we review landmark experimental achievements, from the early observation of the onset of quantum degeneracy and superfluidity to the demonstration of the Mott insulator regime and the emergence of long-range anti-ferromagnetic order. We conclude by discussing future challenges, including the possible observation of high-Tc superconductivity, transport properties, and the interplay of strong correlations and disorder or topology.}

abstract = {Detecting topological order in cold-atom experiments is an ongoing challenge, the resolution of which offers novel perspectives on topological matter. In material systems, unambiguous signatures of topological order exist for topological insulators and quantum Hall devices. In quantum Hall systems, the quantized conductivity and the associated robust propagating edge modes—guaranteed by the existence of nontrivial topological invariants—have been observed through transport and spectroscopy measurements. Here, we show that optical-lattice-based experiments can be tailored to directly visualize the propagation of topological edge modes. Our method is rooted in the unique capability for initially shaping the atomic gas and imaging its time evolution after suddenly removing the shaping potentials. Our scheme, applicable to an assortment of atomic topological phases, provides a method for imaging the dynamics of topological edge modes, directly revealing their angular velocity and spin structure.}}

abstract={For time-reversal symmetric cold atomic insulating systems, it is found that the usual driving approach based on electromagnetic field used in solid state systems loses its power to drive them from trivial regimes to topological regimes if the driven systems still hold time-reversal symmetry (TRS). For such systems, we point out that simply varying the optical lattice potential periodically provides a general and effective way to drive them into topological regimes without breaking their symmetries. Based on this approach, we find that the time-reversal symmetric Kane-Mele model can be effectively driven from the trivial phase to topological phases named as Floquet Quantum Spin Hall insulator. Due to the existence of two gaps in the Floquet system, this novel state of matter can stably host one or two pair of gapless helical states on the same boundary, which suggests this state is not a simple analog of the Quantum Spin Hall insulator. This new driving approach to a system without TRS is also investigated.},

abstract = {A new formula for fusion cross sections is proposed with less parameters and better understanding of fusion physics. It is based on the complex nuclear potential in connection with the Coulomb repulsion field. It reproduces the ENDF/B-VI data from 200eV to 280keV for D+T fusion reaction reasonably well. The widely used formula in NRL's Handbook is discussed while some mistakes there are corrected. This formalism is particularly useful in searching the low energy resonance between two charged nuclei.}

  abstract = "Fusion energy is considered to be the ultimate energy source,
              which does not contribute to climate change compared with
              conventional fossil fuel. It is massive compared with
              unconventional renewable energy and demonstrates fewer safety
              features compared with unconventional fission energy. During the
              past several decades, never-ceasing efforts have been made to
              peacefully utilize the fusion energy in various approaches,
              especially inertial confinement and magnetic confinement. In this
              paper, the main developments of magnetic confinement fusion with
              emphasis on confinement systems as well as challenges of
              materials related to superconducting magnet and plasmafacing
              components are reviewed. The scientific feasibility of magnetic
              confinement fusion has been demonstrated in JET, TFTR, JT-60, and
              EAST, which instigates the construction of the International
              Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). A fusion roadmap to
              DEMO and commercial fusion power plant has been established and
              steady progresses have been made to achieve the ultimate energy
              source.",

  abstract = "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) was recently adopted by
              the semiconductor industry as the leading-edge lithography
              technique for continued miniaturization of semiconductor devices
              in line with Moore's law. EUVL has emerged as a critical
              technique, taking advantage of shorter wavelengths to achieve
              nanoscale feature sizes with higher precision and lower defect
              rates than previous lithography methods. This Primer
              comprehensively explores the technical evolution from deep
              ultraviolet to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography,
              highlighting innovative approaches in source technology, resist
              materials and optical systems developed to meet the stringent
              requirements of high-volume manufacturing. Beginning with an
              overview of the fundamental principles of photolithography, the
              main components and functionalities of EUV scanners are
              described. It also covers exposure tools that support research
              and early development phases. Key topics --- such as image
              formation, photoresist platforms and pattern transfer --- are
              explained with an emphasis on improving resolution and
              throughput. Additionally, persistent challenges are addressed,
              such as stochastic effects and resist sensitivity, with insights
              provided into future directions for EUVL, including
              high-numerical aperture systems and novel resist platforms. This
              Primer aims to present a detailed review of current EUVL
              capabilities and project the future developments and evolution of
              EUVL in semiconductor manufacturing.",
